    <p>Welcome to EZ-RSVP! EZ-RSVP is an event reservation website that aims to make your event planning go smoothly.

    Whether you're planning a small gathering with friends or a corporate conference, you can easily invite people you know
    with a link.  With a user friendly interface, you can easily keep track of reservations, collect important information 
    through a questionare, and host your event publicly on the website.

    We understand that planning an event can be overwhelming, which is why we've designed our website to provide all the 
    logistics you need in one place. From detailed event descriptions and photos to questionares asked with every
    reservation, our site offers everything you need to take your event to the next level.
