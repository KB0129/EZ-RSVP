    <p>Welcome to EZ-RSVP! EZ-RSVP is an event reservation website that aims to make your event planning go smoothly.

    through a questionare, and host your event publicly on the website.

    We understand that planning an event can be overwhelming, which is why we've designed our website to provide all the 
    logistics you need in one place. From detailed event descriptions and photos to questionares asked with every
